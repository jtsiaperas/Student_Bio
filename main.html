	        Austin grew up in the suburbs of DC and has lived in Chicago since 2008. He is an avid collector of cats, with 3 currently in his apartment. There is nothing he loves more than an evening playing videogames with his ragdoll Ripley sitting on his lap.

	        Austin has scattered programming experience and learned to read by playing Eye of The Beholder and Reader Rabbit. He is particularly interested in data analysis, and is looking forward to learning Python.
